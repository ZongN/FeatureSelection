# Feature Selection
I wrote the simple code to merge several methods of the feature selection and the classifier methods of machine learning.
By useing this code, we can get the result after feature selection, and we can also know the results after classification.
Through the classification results, we can understand the quality of the features after selected.

*All the classifiers are call the R package [*caret*](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html "caret")*

*Some features selection methods are call the R package [*mRMRe*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/mRMRe/versions/1.0.1/topics/mRMR.classic " mRMRe v1.0.1"), and matlab code [*OMICFS*](https://github.com/lhqxinghun/bioinformatics/tree/master/OMICFS "Git-OMICFS")*


## Feature Selection Methods:
* SSKM
* mRMR
* OMICFS

## Classifier Methods:
* SVM
* LDA
* xgBoost
* Randomforest
* Logistic regression
* NaiveBayes
